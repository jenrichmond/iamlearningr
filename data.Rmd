Often R learning resources use boring data examples that are embedded into base R (i.e. iris, mtcars). Sometimes you need a middle ground between these boring examples and your   "real" data, which sometimes can be a bit too real. 

Here are a few places to find examples that are interesting to play with, but not too hard.

# Penguins

Allison Horst recently posted a link to this penguin dataset on Twitter. Is it iris-esque, but about penguins! Data from the original paper were analysed to determine whether across different species of Antarctic penguins different characteristics predict whether the penguins are male or female. 

- File: [penguin.csv](/data/penguins.csv)
- ResearchQ: Do the characteristics that best predict whether an Antarctic penguin is male or female differ across species?
