### 7. [Statistics of DOOM](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCMdihazndR0f9XBoSXWqnYg) by Erin Buchanan

If you like to watch youtube and learn stats, rather than read and learn stats, try Dr Erin Buchanan's [Statistics of DOOM](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCMdihazndR0f9XBoSXWqnYg) youtube channel and associated [website](https://statisticsofdoom.com/). She is an A/Prof at Missouri State and teaches tons of stats courses and gives them all away.
